RAHAL: A Terrestrial Robotic Platform for Extreme Environments

This repository documents our journey in building RAHAL, a six-wheeled robotic platform designed to navigate rugged and uneven terrains with stability and precision. RAHAL was developed as part of our senior design project at Hashemite University, combining expertise in mechanical design, manufacturing, and control systems to create a versatile and robust robotic solution.

Project Overview

RAHAL is a six-wheeled robotic platform inspired by NASA's rocker-bogie suspension system, designed to traverse challenging terrains with stability and adaptability. Key features include:

    Rocker-Bogie Suspension: Ensures all wheels maintain contact with uneven surfaces for maximum traction.

    Ackermann Steering Geometry: Enables precise and efficient turning on rough terrain.

    Real-Time Control Algorithms: Developed using Arduino for responsive and adaptable navigation.

The platform was validated through Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations, and its components were manufactured using CNC machining, 3D printing, and welding.
